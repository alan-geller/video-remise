                    VideoRemise works with your scoring machine and up to three
                cameras to provide instant replay for fencing matches. It is open source 
                so you can modify it or add features yourself if you like. VideoRemise
                lives on

                    The main display has a command bar on the top and the video display below that.
                The left side of the command bar shows the current system status; immediately below
                that, the names of the fencers in the current match will be displayed if they have
                been entered.

                    If there are multiple cameras, the video display area will show video from each 
                camera.
                Double-clicking on the video from one camera will expand that video and hide the
                others; double-clicking again will return to the multi-camera view.

                    VideoRemise starts in Idle state. In this mode, it displays the live feed from
                each camera on the main video display. No video is recorded.

                VideoRemise transitions to the Recording state. In this mode it continues to

                    When a trigger occurs, either a hit signalled by the scoring machine or a
                hit or halt signalled manually (see below), VideoRemise enters the Replaying
                state. In this mode, it will replay the last action (a few seconds before and
                after the trigger) in a continuous loop.

                    While in the Replaying mode, VideoRemise continues to record the feed and look

                replaying the previous action and start replaying the new action.
